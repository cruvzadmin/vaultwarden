Recent work on SignIn.js and UI updates indicate progress.
Integrate Vaultwarden authentication API: Not checked
No mention in the repo or status file about API integration.
Implement credential dashboard (RDP/SSH, org/team access): Not checked
No dashboard present yet.
Phase 4: Integration & Testing
❌ Pending:
Frontend–API connection, authentication flow tests, security testing.
Phase 5: Deployment & Employee Onboarding
❌ Pending:
Frontend cloud deployment, DNS/SSL for frontend, onboarding/training.
Phase 6: Maintenance & Scaling
❌ Pending:
Backups, monitoring, updates, feedback loop.
Current Status (from file)

Phase 3: Next step (choose frontend tech, share logo/branding)
Phase 4–6: Pending
Repo Analysis
Frontend stack: Likely React (due to the presence of SignIn.js and Tailwind CSS), but not explicitly checked in your roadmap.

Sign-in Page: You are actively building and refining the sign-in page.
API Integration: Not started or completed.

You have completed all backend setup and planning phases.
Your project is currently in Phase 3 (Custom Frontend Development), with partial progress:

Next steps:

Confirm/check off "Choose frontend stack" and "Design logo/branding assets" if complete.
Complete and finalize sign-in page UI.
